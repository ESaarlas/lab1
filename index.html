  <p>Born in Atlanta, Georgia on a Monday morning in May. I am most appreciative of the 30+ countries Iâ€™ve visited or lived in. International perspective is something I value most in life for it has strengthened my open-mindedness. I wish to use my skills in programming and wide scale of knowledge in world culture to better the world I will grow up in.</p>
